Gut to soil Axis
To study the microbiome composition of duckweeds, samples were collected directly from pond water and from duckweed scimmed off the surface of a pond. 
The data used is Illumina HiSeq 2500, paired-end, 250 bp sequencing reads.
The goal is to align 16s regions, classify microbes, create a phylogenetic tree visualization of microbe relationships, and create diversity metrics of the dataset.
